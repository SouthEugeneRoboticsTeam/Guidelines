# Issues Style Guide

1. [Format](#1---format)

## 1 - Format

Issues should follow the repository's [issue format](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) if one is provided. Otherwise, they should follow these guidelines:

1. Keep the title short and to-the-point
1. Do not use tags in the title such as "[BUG] The program doesn't work"
1. Label all issues with the appropriate label(s)
	- "enhancement" - A new feature
	- "bug" - An issue/bug
	- "question" - A question about the code
	- "duplicate" - A duplicate issue; the original should be kept and not tagged
	- "invalid" - Not an actual issue
	- "wontfix" - An enhancement or bug that will not be added or fixed
1. Search to verify the issue has not already been reported
1. Assign milestones to all issues
1. Describe the exact issue in the body and what happens
1. Describe a possible way to fix the issue if one has been thought of

Example:

```
Title: Add autonomous
Labels: enhancement
Milestones: scrimmage
Body:
	We need to have an autonomous with the following functions:

	- <function 1>
	- <function 2>
	- <etc>
```
